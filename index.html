                felt it was time someone gave it the spotlight it deserves. especially for the ones who live by this
                virtue: the trustworthy.
                <br><br>
                so we thought of creating a system that rewards its members for doing good and being trustworthy. this
                way, trust as a virtue becomes something to aspire to, just the way it should be. then we went one step
                ahead: we built it. we know we are on the right track because here you are.
